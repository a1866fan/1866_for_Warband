# Overview and features
This is my attempt to port the excellent 1866 mod for Mount &amp; Blade over to Warband. On Warband, it immediately grants several benefits over the native M&B version:
- Ctrl+space fast forward time
- Widescreen aspect ratio
- No more frequent crashing due to RGL Error- Unable to restore vertex buffer 

Features were also added/fixed:
- Kills made with shotguns now grant experience

# Installation
Unzip the files into the directory "<your Mount&Blade Warband folder>\Modules\1866 for Warband"

# Issues
Several issues persist:
- No multiplayer (Yet!)
- Enemies that spawn in That Town spawn immediately instead of after triggering them
- No sitting animation for NPCs in saloons

# Credits
- Credits to the original developers of the 1866 mod.  
- Credits to swyter of The Last Days of the Third Age mod, hosted at https://github.com/tldmod/tldmod. TLD's source code is invaluable as reference for the differences between M&B Native and M&B Warband. Also, I copied the code to transit to the Quick Battle presentation screen when the "Quick Battle" menu item is clicked. Last but not least, the mod is hosted as a Github repo, mimicking TLD.

# Disclaimer
This is my first time making Warband mods and first time using Github so expect lots of mistakes along the way
